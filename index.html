        A Short History of Git As with many great things in life, Git began with
        a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy. The Linux kernel is
        an open source software project of fairly large scope. During the early
        years of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the
        software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the
        Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. In
        2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux
        kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down,
        and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the
        Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the
        creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons
        they learned while using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system
        were as follows: Speed Simple design Strong support for non-linear
        development (thousands of parallel branches) Fully distributed Able to
        handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data
        size) Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to
        use and yet retain these initial qualities. It’s amazingly fast, it’s
        very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching
        system for non-linear development
